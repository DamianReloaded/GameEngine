# GameEngine
C++ OpenGL Game Engine for Linux / Windows

The idea is to provide with the game most of the libraries required to run it in the hope the binary will "just work" once unpacked.

- System dependencies
  - X11
  - GL
  - GLU
  - Xrandr
- Local folder dependencies
  - Glew (shared)
  - LodePNG (compiled in)
